## 🏆 Tournament Scoring Rules

Based on official Catan tournament guidelines:

### Game Winner Determination
1. First player to reach the required VP on **their turn** wins
2. Players cannot win on another player's turn (even if they reach required VP)
3. VP development cards can be revealed immediately to win if they bring you to required VP

### Tournament Ranking (Preliminary Rounds)

Players are ranked in the following order:

1. **Number of Victories** (primary ranking)
   - Most game wins ranks highest

2. **Total Victory Points** (first tiebreaker)
   - Sum of all VP across all games
   - Maximum 10 VP per game counted (even if player scored more)

3. **Victory Point Percentage (VP%)** (second tiebreaker)
   - For each game: Player's VP ÷ Total table VP = Game VP%
   - Sum all game VP% for total VP%
   - For 3-player games: Add "dummy score" (average of 3 players) to normalize

4. **Higher Placement Finishes** (third tiebreaker)
   - Number of 2nd place finishes
   - Then number of 3rd place finishes

5. **Drawing Lots** (final tiebreaker)
   - Random selection if all else is tied

### Important Tournament Notes
- Games continue until someone reaches required VP (no time limits on games)
- Individual turns may have time limits
- Development cards with VP can be played immediately for victory
- Knight cards must wait until next turn (cannot win immediately after playing)

### Custom Tournament Scoring (This Tracker)

This tracker implements a **skill-weighted scoring system** that heavily rewards competitive achievement:

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Tournament Points = (0.25 × Games Played) + (0.5 × Average VPs per Game) + (7 × Wins)
```

**Point Breakdown:**
- **0.25 points** per game played (minimal participation credit)
- **0.5 × average VPs per game** (rewards consistent performance)
- **7 points** per game won (heavily rewards competitive wins - the hardest achievement)

**How It Works:**
1. Each game played adds 0.25 points (reduced to de-emphasize mere attendance)
2. Your average victory points per game is multiplied by 0.5
3. Each game you win adds 7 points (increased to properly reward the hardest metric)
4. Players are ranked by total tournament points (highest to lowest)

**Example:**
- Player A: 10 games, 5 wins, 95 VPs (9.5 avg) → Score: (0.25×10) + (0.5×9.5) + (7×5) = **42.25 points**
- Player B: 8 games, 6 wins, 88 VPs (11 avg) → Score: (0.25×8) + (0.5×11) + (7×6) = **49.5 points**
- Player C: 20 games, 2 wins, 140 VPs (7 avg) → Score: (0.25×20) + (0.5×7) + (7×2) = **22.5 points**

**Why This Formula:**
- Winning is the hardest achievement (must beat 3-5 opponents), so it gets the highest weight
- 1 win = 28 games of participation (prevents grinding)
- 1 win = 14 avg VPs worth of performance
- Ratio: 1 : 2 : 28 (games : avg VPs : wins)
- Rewards skill and competitive success over mere participation
- Ideal for competitive tournaments

This system heavily rewards winning (7 pts per win) as the primary achievement, while giving appropriate credit for performance quality and minimal credit for participation.

## 🎯 Point Values (Custom Rules)

### Cities and Metropolises
- **Cities:** 2 Victory Points each

- **Total for Metropolis:** 4 VP (2 for city + 2 for metropolis upgrade)

---

## 📝 Using the Tracker

### Recording Scores
1. Select the appropriate game variant
2. The tracker will show relevant VP sources for that variant
3. Enter the actual VP earned from each source
4. Total VP is calculated automatically
5. Players are ranked by total VP

### Best Practices
- Record all VP sources accurately
- Double-check totals match the game winner's declared VP
- For tournament play, note that max 10 VP per game for ranking calculations
- Use the "description" field to note any special scenario rules
