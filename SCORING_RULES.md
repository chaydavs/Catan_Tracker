## 🏆 Tournament Scoring Rules

Based on official Catan tournament guidelines:

### Game Winner Determination
1. First player to reach the required VP on **their turn** wins
2. Players cannot win on another player's turn (even if they reach required VP)
3. VP development cards can be revealed immediately to win if they bring you to required VP

### Tournament Ranking (Preliminary Rounds)

Players are ranked in the following order:

1. **Number of Victories** (primary ranking)
   - Most game wins ranks highest

2. **Total Victory Points** (first tiebreaker)
   - Sum of all VP across all games
   - Maximum 10 VP per game counted (even if player scored more)

3. **Victory Point Percentage (VP%)** (second tiebreaker)
   - For each game: Player's VP ÷ Total table VP = Game VP%
   - Sum all game VP% for total VP%
   - For 3-player games: Add "dummy score" (average of 3 players) to normalize

4. **Higher Placement Finishes** (third tiebreaker)
   - Number of 2nd place finishes
   - Then number of 3rd place finishes

5. **Drawing Lots** (final tiebreaker)
   - Random selection if all else is tied

### Important Tournament Notes
- Games continue until someone reaches required VP (no time limits on games)
- Individual turns may have time limits
- Development cards with VP can be played immediately for victory
- Knight cards must wait until next turn (cannot win immediately after playing)
